## How to Contribute? ✍️

- First, refer to the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Kreateer/automatic-file-sorter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Take a look at the existing Issues or create your own Issues to work on!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you before you start working on it.
- Fork the repository and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working on.
- Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions might be added to improve it.
- Optional, but it would be helpful if you added screenshots to help everyone know how your fix or new feature works.

Otherwise, if you are **new to GitHub** or have **never contributed** to GH projects, you can refer to these **helpful guides** on how to contribute:
